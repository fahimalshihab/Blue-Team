### Attack vector
An attack vector is a path, method or means by which cybercriminals penetrate a target system. Attack vectors can include cybercriminal tools and actions, as well as the human factor or vulnerable technologies on the side of the potential victim and their contractors. The set of all possible attack vectors in a system or organization is called the attack surface.

#### Incident response is the strategic, organized responsed an organization uses following a cyberattack. The response is executed according to planned procedures that seek to limit damage and repair breached vulnerabilities in systems.

IT professionals use incident response plans to manage security incidents. Having a clearly defined incident response plan can limit attack damage, lower costs, and save time after a security breach.

A cyberattack or data breach can cause huge damage to an organization, potentially affecting its customers, brand value, intellectual property, and time and resources. Incident response aims to reduce the damage an attack causes and help the organization recover as quickly as possible.

## TOOLS
#### TheHive
TheHive is a powerful open-source platform that provides security teams with an integrated suite of tools for threat intelligence and incident response. It is designed to help security teams streamline their incident response processes and improve collaboration among team members.
  
#### AlienVault OSSIM
AlienVault OSSIM is trusted by security professionals across the globe
AlienVault® OSSIM™ is a feature-rich, open-source security information and event management (SIEM) that includes event collection, normalization, and correlation. AlienVault OSSIM was launched by engineers because of a lack of available open-source products and to address the reality many security professionals face, which is that a SIEM, whether it is open source or commercial, is no good if it does not provide security visibility.

#### The HELK
The Hunting ELK or simply the HELK is one of the first open source hunt platforms with advanced analytics capabilities such as SQL declarative language, graphing, structured streaming, and even machine learning via Jupyter notebooks and Apache Spark over an ELK stack.

#### Volatility (command-line tool)
Volatility is an open-source memory forensics framework used for analyzing volatile memory (RAM) from computer systems. It helps digital forensic investigators extract and analyze information such as running processes, open network connections, registry keys, and other valuable data from a system’s memory. This is particularly useful for investigating cyberattacks, malware, and other security incidents.

#### Demisto
Demisto is a security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform that combines full incident management, security automation and orchestration, and real-time collaboration to improve the efficiency of your security operations and incident response. The Demisto app on Cortex™ provides automated alert ingestion, real-time execution of response actions within Demisto, and unified activation of your security product stack through task-based playbooks.

#### Atomic Red
Atomic Red Team is a library of tests that every security team can execute to simulate adversarial activity and validate their defenses. Tests are focused, have few dependencies, and are defined in a structured format that can be used by automation frameworks.And library of tests mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework.

#### Mitre Caldera
Caldera™ is an adversary emulation platform designed to easily run autonomous breach-and-attack simulation exercises. It can also be used to run manual red-team engagements or automated incident response. Caldera is built on the MITRE ATT&CK™ framework and is an active research project at MITRE.

#### OSSEC
Ossec : It claims to be the world's most widely used open-source host-based intrusion detection system. In short, we can call it HIDS. It performs log analysis, integrity checking, Windows registry monitoring, rootkit detection, time-based alerting, and active response, File Integrity Monitoring(FIM), Compliance Auditing.

#### Osquery
osquery is an operating system instrumentation framework for collecting information from operating systems, hypervisors and applications. It is often used to collect information for security forensics, application performance management and compliance auditing.

#### Cuckoo
Cuckoo is an open source automated malware analysis system. It's used to automatically run and analyze files and collect comprehensive analysis results that outline what the malware does while running inside an isolated operating system.

#### MISP
FIRST Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) instance
MISP is a community-driven software project that enables sharing, storing and correlation of Indicators of Compromise of targeted attacks. The instance is open and automatically enabled for all FIRST members.

#### Ghidra
Ghidra is a free and open source reverse engineering tool developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States.

#### SNORT
SNORT is a powerful open-source intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS) that provides real-time network traffic analysis and data packet logging.
