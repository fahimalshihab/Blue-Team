### Attack vector
An attack vector is a path, method or means by which cybercriminals penetrate a target system. Attack vectors can include cybercriminal tools and actions, as well as the human factor or vulnerable technologies on the side of the potential victim and their contractors. The set of all possible attack vectors in a system or organization is called the attack surface.

#### Incident response is the strategic, organized responsed an organization uses following a cyberattack. The response is executed according to planned procedures that seek to limit damage and repair breached vulnerabilities in systems.

IT professionals use incident response plans to manage security incidents. Having a clearly defined incident response plan can limit attack damage, lower costs, and save time after a security breach.

A cyberattack or data breach can cause huge damage to an organization, potentially affecting its customers, brand value, intellectual property, and time and resources. Incident response aims to reduce the damage an attack causes and help the organization recover as quickly as possible.
