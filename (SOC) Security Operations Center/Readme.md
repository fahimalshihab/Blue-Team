# SOC
Security operations center is responsible for protecting an organization against cyber threats. SOC analysts perform round-the-clock monitoring of an organization’s network and investigate any potential security incidents.
### Mission
- Overall cybersecurity is like a three-layered shield:<b> Prevention, Detection, and Response</b>.
  
- In a <b>Security Operations Center (SOC)</b>, our focus is on the last two layers – <b>Detection and Response</b>. We're constantly on watch, ready to identify and stop threats that slip through the initial defenses.

### Roles

- <b>Security Analyst:</b> The cybersecurity first responders who monitor security alerts, investigate suspicious activity, and take steps to contain threats.
  
- <b>Security Engineer:</b> They maintain and update the security tools and systems used by the SOC team, ensuring they are functioning properly and configured effectively.

- <b>Security Manager:</b> Oversees the day-to-day operations of the SOC, including scheduling, staffing, and ensuring the team has the resources they need to be successful.

- <b>Chief Information Security Officer (CISO):</b> Holds leadership responsibility for the organization's overall security posture and provides direction to the SOC team.

- <b>Threat Hunter:</b> These proactive cybersecurity specialists actively search for hidden threats that might evade traditional security tools. They act like digital detectives, analyzing data and user behavior to identify potential threats before they can cause damage.

### Tools
#### SEIM (Security Information and Event Management)
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It's a software platform that acts as a central hub for collecting, analyzing, and storing security data from various sources across your network.

- <b>Data Collection:</b> SIEM gathers security logs and events from firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), antivirus software, endpoint security tools, and other security devices.

- <b>Normalization & Aggregation:</b> The collected data can be in different formats. SIEM normalizes this data into a common format for easier analysis. It also aggregates the data, grouping similar events together.

- <b>Analysis & Correlation:</b> SIEM analyzes the normalized and aggregated data to identify potential security threats. It can correlate seemingly unrelated events from different sources to discover a larger attack pattern.

- <b>Alerting & Reporting:</b> If SIEM detects suspicious activity, it generates alerts to notify security analysts who can investigate further. It can also generate reports that provide insights into overall security posture and trends.

####  XDR (Extended Detection and Response)
XDR, which stands for Extended Detection and Response, is a cybersecurity technology that goes beyond traditional security solutions. It provides a more holistic approach to threat detection and response by collecting and analyzing data from a wide range of sources across your IT infrastructure.

- <b>Unified Data Collection:</b> XDR ingests data from various security tools like endpoint security, network security, cloud security, and email security. This comprehensive view helps identify threats that might otherwise be missed by siloed security systems.

- <b>Advanced Analytics & Correlation:</b> XDR uses advanced analytics and machine learning to correlate data from different sources. This allows it to identify complex attack patterns and potential threats that might be hidden in isolated alerts.

- <b>Automated Response:</b> Some XDR solutions can automate incident response actions, such as isolating infected devices or blocking malicious traffic. This helps to minimize the impact of a security incident.

- <b>Improved Threat Hunting:</b> XDR can empower security analysts by providing them with a broader context for security events. This allows them to hunt for threats more effectively and investigate incidents faster.

#### SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)
SOAR, which stands for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response, is a software solution designed to streamline security operations in a Security Operations Center (SOC). It acts like a central nervous system for your security team, helping them work more efficiently and effectively.

- <b>Security Orchestration:</b> SOAR connects and coordinates all your disparate security tools and platforms. This includes firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), endpoint security tools, and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems. By creating a single interface, SOAR eliminates the need for security analysts to switch between different tools, saving them valuable time.

- <b>Security Automation:</b> One of the biggest benefits of SOAR is its ability to automate repetitive tasks. Security analysts are often bogged down by manual tasks like collecting data, investigating low-level alerts, and running basic remediation steps. SOAR can automate these tasks, freeing up analysts to focus on higher-priority investigations and strategic threat hunting.

- <b>Incident Response:</b> SOAR plays a crucial role in incident response by providing a central platform to manage the entire incident lifecycle. It can automate tasks like isolating infected devices, blocking malicious traffic, and notifying the appropriate personnel. SOAR can also help with incident reporting and post-incident analysis.
